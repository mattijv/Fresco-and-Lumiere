Fresco & Lumiere
======

Fresco and Lumiere are ComputerCraft programs designed to create images in Minecraft using Glowstone Illuminators from Thermal Expansion. Fresco can be used with an Engineering Turtle to build a static image. Lumier connects to an array of Glowstone Illuminators with a wired modem and can update the "screen" dynamically.

### Options

Full syntax for invoking fresco is

  fresco [-h] [-u playername] [url] [size]

- -h parameter makes the turtle build the image horizontally instead of vertically.
- With -u you can specify a player name and fresco will get the skin the player uses and builds the face part of it.
- Size is the size in blocks for the largest dimension (by default all pictures are scaled down to 128 on the largest dimension, but you can request smaller or larger). Player faces are 8 x 8 by default.
